# Unity-Hangman

This is a simple Hangman game developed using Unity and C#. The game allows players to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. The objective is to guess the word before running out of attempts. The game features both a single-player mode and a two-player mode where one player inputs the word and the other player guesses it.
